## 2024-05-23 - IDOR in Order Management
**Vulnerability:** IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) in `findAllOrders` and `findOrderById`.
**Learning:** `model/order.js` methods were designed to fetch all data without filtering by user, and the controller was blindly calling them even though the route was protected. The `protectRoute` middleware authenticates the user but does not automatically scope data access.
**Prevention:** Always pass `req.user.id` to data access layers for user-specific resources. Use `findFirst` with `{ id, userId }` instead of `findUnique` when enforcing ownership.
